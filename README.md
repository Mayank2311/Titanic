* In this project, We take the raw data and interpret the patterns and trends in the data by cleaning, wrangling and analyzing. 
* Perform statistical analyses to obtain useful outputs.
* Outputs are represent in a graphical representation manner for the better understanding of the data using multiple libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn etc. 
* Create and Train Logistic Regression Model which predicts whether a given passenger survived or not.
* By using the outputs we made the some future predictions using Logistic regression.
* Evaluate the Model Accuracy.
